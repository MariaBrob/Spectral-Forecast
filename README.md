An implementation by Brobonea Maria after Paul A. Gagniuc et al. Spectral Forecast: A general purpose prediction model as an alternative to classical neural networks. Chaos 30, 033119 (2020); doi: 10.1063/1.5120818 https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5120818

### Description
The project is based on 3 input matrices, A, B and P, used in order to calculate a 3D prediction matrix, M. A similarity index is calculated comparating each layer of M matrix with P. The result are printed in the console and interpreted in a plot.

### Requirements
The project uses NodeJs. In order to run it, you should install the nodeplotlib
